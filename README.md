# Python-Final-Project
CSCI-3351 final project.
Team: Sour Patch Kids
Members: Nathan Platt, Tomas Rios, Anthony Saldana, Jake Sullivan, Elaina Rivers

Included is a ZIP file of our written report, a PowerPoint presentation in the form of a PDF and our code. For our project, we created a jewelry store. Our jewelry store has a product page, individual pages for individual products, a checkout page and various account pages (login, signup, etc.). We referenced this video https://youtu.be/YZvRrldjf1Y (found on the Final Project Plan assignment page on Canvas) heavily throughout the coding process, hence why the website at the end of the video looks very similar to ours; we used the same templates/assets. Other sources used can be found in the report. Prior to this project, none of us knew anything about working with Visual Studio or Django, so we learned a lot throughout the process, both from the video and from our own experimentation with the code.
